    """converts .mat files with spectrograms to .spect files

    Parameters
    ----------
    mat_spect_files : list
        of str, full path to .mat files
        path to directory containing .mat files
    mat_spects_annotation_file : str
        full path to annotation file containing 'keys' and 'elements'
        where 'keys' are filenames of audio files and 'elements'
        contains additional annotation not found in .mat files
    output_dir : str
        full path to directory where .spect files will be saved
    labels_mapping : dict
        maps str labels to consecutive integer values {0,1,2,...N} where N
        is the number of classes / label types.
        Default is None -- currently not implemented.
    skip_files_with_labels_not_in_labelset : bool
        if True, skip .mat files where the 'labels' contains str labels
        not found in labels_mapping
    n_decimals_trunc : int
        number of decimal places to keep when truncating timebin_dur
        default is 3

    Returns
    -------
    spect_files_path : str
        Full path to file called 'spect_files'
        which contains a list of three-element tuples:
            spect_filename : str, filename of `.spect` file
            spect_dur : float, duration of the spectrogram from cbin
            labels : str, labels from .cbin.not.mat associated with .cbin
                     (string labels for syllables in spectrogram)
        Used when building data sets of a specific duration.

    The fucntion saves a .spect file for each .mat file containing a
    spectrogram. Each .mat file with a spectrogram should contains the following
    keys:
        s : ndarray
            the spectrogram
        f : ndarray
            vector of values at bin centers for frequencies in spectrogram
        t : ndarray
            vector of values for bin centers for times in spectrogram
        labels : ndarray
            vector of same length as t where each value is a label for that time bin
    containing the spectrograms.

    If a .mat file does not contain these keys, the function skips that file.
